				<h2>Wolfenstein is ....</h2>
				<p>a series of World War II video games, originally developed by Muse Software.</p>
				<p>The first two games in the series, Castle Wolfenstein and Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, were stealth-based and featured a 2D top-down perspective. The third game in the franchise, Wolfenstein 3D, developed by id Software, introduced a first-person perspective with faster-paced action. Because of this, it is widely regarded to have helped popularize the first-person shooter genre. In 2001, the series was rebooted with Return to Castle Wolfenstein, developed by Gray Matter Interactive. It was then followed in 2003 by Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, by Splash Damage. Raven Software's Wolfenstein followed in 2009. After Bethesda Softworks acquired id Software, MachineGames released Wolfenstein: The New Order in 2014 and a standalone expansion Wolfenstein: The Old Blood in 2015. A direct sequel to The New Order entitled Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus was released on October 27, 2017.</p>
				<p>The majority of the games follow protagonist William "B.J." Blazkowicz, and his fights against the Nazi powers. Earlier titles are centered around Nazis attempting to harness supernatural and occult forces. The New Order and its sequel The New Colossus are set in an alternate history in which the Axis powers won the Second World War.</p>

					<div class="timeline-item" date-is="2014">
						<h2>Wolfenstein: The New Order</h2>
						<p>This installment is a soft reboot of the franchise and builds an entirely new chronology, set in an alternate universe where the Axis powers won World War II. In 1946, as the Nazis expand their regime all over the world, OSA agent William "B.J." Blazkowicz is sent to assassinate the notorious evil mastermind, General Deathshead, a familiar face from the previous encounters, as part of a last all-out effort by Allied airborne and commando forces. The mission is a failure and, after the entire unit is slaughtered by the Nazi forces, Blazkowicz barely escapes the compound, sustaining a critical head injury which renders him unconscious and subsequently puts him in a coma.</p>
						<p>In 1960, fourteen years later, BJ finds himself settled in an asylum, unaware of the events that took place during his coma, and about to be executed by the Nazis who have ordered the asylum liquidated. Awakened into full strength, Blazkowicz fights his way out of the building, escaping with a wounded nurse, Anya. Heavily irritated by the revelation of the enemy winning the war, BJ operates within the shadows to locate The Resistance and help them fight the Nazis, dismantling them and ultimately crippling their dominance around the world.</p>

					<div class="timeline-item" date-is="2015">

Blazkowicz and Richard Wesley, also known as Agent One, who are sent to infiltrate Castle Wolfenstein and obtain a top secret folder that contains the whereabouts of General Deathshead. The mission goes awry as they are discovered by the Nazi troopers and are captured. During brutal interrogation, Agent One is killed, but Blazkowicz manages to evade the Nazi forces and escape the castle.</p>
						<p>With the aid of Kessler, the leader of a local resistance group, he discovers that the folder is held by Helga von Schabbs, a Nazi neurologist who has just arrived in the village of Wulfburg. Evidence begins to emerge of supernatural activities taking place under the command of von Schabbs, who is conducting an archaeological excavation in an attempt to find a hidden underground vault containing occult knowledge previously possessed by German King Otto I.</p>

					<div class="timeline-item" date-is="2017">
						<h2>Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</h2>
