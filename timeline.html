				<h2>Wolfenstein Universe</h2>
				<p>There are multiple versions of Wolfenstein 3D with various alternate game endings per the various versions of the games, in addition to alternate backstories in manuals and game guides (and additional material added in 'later games') which discuss various and often inconsistent details. So there isn't necessarily a 'consistent' 'Classic' timeline related to the game (but what is included below is based on the related material).</p>
				<p>There is some overlap between Original Timeline, and the Wolfenstein/Doom/ID universe timeline (which is based on material up to Wolfenstein RPG and RTCW, bu  released mostly before Wolfenstein (2009). But again it is influenced by any inconsistencies involved with the various source material.</p>

				<h2>Original Series</h2>
				<p>August 17, 1943 - During the first Schweinfurt raid: World War II is raging across Europe, and Castle Wolfenstein has been occupied by the Nazis and converted into their HQ. A soldier was captured behind enemy lines and awaited interrogation and torture by the dreaded SS in the dungeons of Castle Wolfenstein. A dying cellmate bequeathed him his only hope - a gun and ten bullets. He escapes and finds the plans for Operation Rheingold and escapes the castle alive.</p>
				<p>July 20, 1944 - Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, a depiction of the real-life attempt on Hitler's life at Wolf's Lair</p>

				<h2>MG Timeline</h2>
				<p>Old Blood and New Order makes certain retcons that may not necessarily fit entirely with Return to Castle Wolfenstein or even Wolfenstein. Such as history elements concerning reimagined "Castle Wolfenstein" itself, Wesley, Kessler, more primitve Super Soldiers (than even those seen in RTCW), changes to geography where Castle Wolfenstien is located, in relation to Paderborn/Wulfburg villages, etc. As such some of these references may seem to be more like homages, nods, injokes and easter eggs to older sources, rather than straight continuity references.</p>

				<p>It is possible that very little of Wolfenstein was utilized as part of plot of Wolfenstein: The New Order.</p>

				<p>
					"...we asked him if the last Activision Wolfenstein game had any baring on their version to which he replied, "No it does not. We try not to include that game as part of our story. Personally, I think that Activision did a crap job."
				</p>

				<p>Infact RTCW itself was published by Activision and was under their direction and may fall under this criticism (though Old Blood itself makes many nods to the game, but reimagines them) or has new characters inspired by characters in the original game (sharing their names and similar outcomes) but portrayed in a different light.</p>

				<p>In fact the designers claimed to be more of a fan of the original games in the series instead (Wolfenstein 3D/Spear of Destiny) and there are nods and callbacks to those games as well.</p>

				<p>This timeline should focus on dates and details specifically confirmed by MG series. As exact dates and references from alternate canons cannot be considered reliable.</p>

				<p>Machine Games series appears to ignore the more 'supernatural' aspects of previous games in the series for a more science fiction approach (and explanations), even when it touches on concepts of 'ancient technologies' and the idea of reanimated corpses (Old Blood). Due to this only the dates or references to events specifically confirmed in MachineGames reboot universe are listed in this timeline.</p>
